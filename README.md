# FortiGate Configuration with Remote Users and Advanced Features

This project provides a FortiGate configuration setup that includes:

- **LDAP Integration**: Remote users and groups are fetched from an LDAP server for centralized authentication and role-based access.
- **LDP (Label Distribution Protocol)**: For MPLS-related dynamic label distribution.
- **SW-WAN (Software-Defined WAN)**: Intelligent WAN path control and link failover.
- **IPsec VPN**: Secure site-to-site or remote access VPN tunnels.
- **Security Profiles**: Deep inspection using Antivirus, Web Filtering, Application Control, and more.

## Key Benefits

- Centralized **user authentication** via LDAP
- Enhanced **network reliability** with SD-WAN
- **Secure communication** using IPsec
- **Granular traffic control** with advanced security profiles
